# Movies; Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)
Module 8:  ETL - Extract, Transform, Load [ETL to SQL File](https://github.com/sqrtofpi/Movies-ETL/blob/3a94fabea0080cd86e1f8f7531a8ab1803bbca3e/ETL_create_database.ipynb)

## Purpose

Amazing Prime upon reviewing our initial dataset, has enlisted our help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, transforms it from multiple datasets to clean and condense the data before updating existing tables. After the data has been transformed to useable data, the program will then load the data to a PostgreSQL database where it can be queried.
